## machine learning practice projects
These are begginer projects from coursera. It is a good start on how to use Tensorflow and Keras to 
perform exploratory data analysis, implement Machine Learning (ML) Models, and learn how to save and load ML models. 
You will find the following projects and datasets:<br>
> 1- Predict if a bank customer will accept a loan offer by the bank using FeedForward Neural Networks (FNN)<br>
2- Predict House Prices using FeedForward Neural Networks (FNN) <br>
3- Handwritten digit classification (mnist image classification) using FeedForward Neural Networks (FNN) <br>
4- CIFAR image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <br>
5- Facial expression classification using Residual Neural Network (ResNet) <br>
